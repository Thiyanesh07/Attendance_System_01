## Quick Camera Setup

| Type | IP Address Example |
|------|-------------------|
| Webcam | `0` or `1` |
| RTSP | `rtsp://admin:pass@192.168.1.100:554/stream` |
| HTTP | `http://192.168.1.101:8080/video` |
| DroidCam | `http://192.168.1.50:4747/video` |

## Training Students

**Method 1: Live Webcam (Recommended)**
1. Add student
2. Click "Train"
3. Choose "Use Webcam"
4. Capture 50 frames

**Method 2: Photo Upload**
1. Add student
2. Click "Train"
3. Choose "Upload Photos"
4. Select 10-50 photos

**Best Results**: 50-100 varied photos

---

## Accuracy Settings

```python
# backend/app/core/config.py

# Detection (lower = more faces detected)
FACE_DETECTION_THRESHOLD = 0.3

# Recognition (higher = stricter matching)
FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.55

# Index type (cosine = better accuracy)
FAISS_INDEX_TYPE = "COSINE"
```

---

## Confidence Score Guide

- **90-100%**: Excellent ✅
- **80-89%**: Good ✅
- **70-79%**: Acceptable ✅
- **55-69%**: Weak ⚠️
- **<55%**: Not recognized ❌

---

## Bounding Box Colors

- 🟢 **Green**: Student recognized
- 🟠 **Orange**: Unknown face

---

## Common Fixes

**No faces detected?**
→ Check lighting, camera angle

**Low confidence?**
→ Add more training photos

**Wrong recognition?**
→ Increase threshold to 0.60

**Missed recognition?**
→ Lower threshold to 0.50

**Slow system?**
→ Reduce FPS/resolution
