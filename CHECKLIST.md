### Using DroidCam (Phone as Camera)

You can use your Android phone as the webcam via DroidCam:

1) On Windows: Install the DroidCam Client (Dev47Apps) and drivers; on Android: install the DroidCam app.
2) Connect phone and PC (Wi‚ÄëFi or USB). Follow the client instructions until you see the phone feed in the Windows client.
3) Refresh the web app page and go to Live Recognition.
4) In the "Select Video Input" dropdown, choose the DroidCam device (it usually shows as "DroidCam Source" or similar).
5) Start recognition.

Note: If you prefer using the IP URL, add the DroidCam HTTP MJPEG URL (e.g., `http://<PHONE_IP>:4747/video`) in Cameras, but the current Live Recognition captures from the browser webcam. The camera dropdown only tags attendance to that camera ID; video is taken from the selected Video Input.

## Troubleshooting

If any checkbox failed, see the relevant section in README.md:

- **GPU issues:** README.md > Troubleshooting > GPU Not Working
  - Run `python backend/check_gpu.py` to diagnose
  - Ensure ONNX Runtime GPU 1.19.2 is installed
  - Verify cuDNN is installed via conda
  - System will automatically fall back to CPU if GPU unavailable
- **Database issues:** README.md > Database Setup
- **Model issues:** MODEL_DOWNLOAD.md
- **Camera issues:** README.md > Troubleshooting > Camera Not Working
- **Recognition issues:** README.md > Troubleshooting > Low Recognition Accuracy

- **Windows psql code page warning:**

  If you see the message:

  > WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)

  Run in PowerShell before starting `psql` to set the console code page to Windows-1252:

  ```powershell
  chcp 1252
  psql -U postgres
  ```

  Alternatively, to force UTF-8 for the session you can set:

  ```powershell
  $env:PGCLIENTENCODING = 'UTF8'
  psql -U postgres
  ```
