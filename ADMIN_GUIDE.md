## 🎯 High-Accuracy Configuration

### Detection Settings (Enhanced)
```python
# backend/app/core/config.py
FACE_DETECTION_THRESHOLD = 0.3  # Lower for better recall
```

**Quality Filtering Applied:**
- Minimum face size: 40×40 pixels
- Maximum face size: 90% of frame (filters false detections)
- Aspect ratio: 0.5 to 2.0 (filters distorted faces)
- Sharpness check: Laplacian variance > 50 (filters blurry faces)
- Final confidence: > 0.4 after quality checks

### Recognition Settings (Enhanced)
```python
# backend/app/core/config.py
FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.55  # Cosine similarity threshold
FAISS_INDEX_TYPE = "COSINE"  # Better than L2 for faces
FAISS_K_NEIGHBORS = 5  # Check top-5 matches
```

**Recognition Process:**
1. Face detected and quality-checked
2. 512-D embedding extracted (ArcFace model)
3. Normalized for cosine similarity
4. Searched against all trained embeddings
5. Top-5 matches retrieved
6. Best match per student selected
7. Filtered by threshold (0.55)
8. Highest confidence match returned

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Fine-Tuning Recognition Accuracy

**If you're getting too many false positives (wrong recognitions):**
1. Increase `FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD` in `backend/app/core/config.py`
   ```python
   FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.60  # Stricter (was 0.55)
   ```
2. Train more photos per student (50-100 images)
3. Ensure training photos are high quality

**If you're getting too many missed recognitions:**
1. Lower `FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD`
   ```python
   FACE_RECOGNITION_THRESHOLD = 0.50  # More lenient (was 0.55)
   ```
2. Add more varied training photos
3. Check camera lighting and positioning

### Camera Optimization

**For better recognition accuracy:**
- **Position cameras** at face level (5-6 feet high)
- **Ensure good lighting** (avoid backlight)
- **Optimal distance**: 3-10 feet from camera
- **Frame rate**: 30 FPS for smooth detection
- **Resolution**: 640x480 (faster) or 1280x720 (more accurate)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No faces detected
- Check camera lighting
- Ensure face is clearly visible
- Check if camera feed is working (grid view)
- Verify detection threshold isn't too high

### Faces detected but not recognized
- Check if student is trained in the system
- Verify training used good quality photos
- Check recognition threshold setting
- Retrain student with more photos

### Low confidence scores
- Add more training photos
- Improve training photo quality
- Ensure consistent lighting
- Check camera positioning

### Attendance not marking
- Verify `mark_attendance` is enabled in code
- Check if attendance already marked today (prevents duplicates)
- Verify student is properly trained
- Check database connection
